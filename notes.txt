Google's T5 model generates questions using context paragraph and answer to generate question.

We can use "context-only-question-generator" model from hugging face which generates question based on only context.

For generating answers using context and question, we can ideally use any DL model which was trained on SQUAD-2.

Here are few models like:
1. deepset/roberta-base-squad2
2. distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad
3. bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad
4. deepset/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad2
etc.
